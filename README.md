The files in this repository were submitted as coursework for GEOG 531 at VIU's ADGISA program. The filepaths direct to coursework on a local computer, and should be adjusted for use outside this context.
Parameters are utilized in these tools, as they are python scripts meant for use in ESRI's ArcGIS Pro 3.x. ARCH_POTENTIAL.tbx and Constraints.tbx include the files archaeological_potential and constraint, constraint_area_buffer, constraint_area_buffer_messages, and contraint_area_buffer_messages_selection respectively. 

Again, these were submitted as coursework and should not be used as tools in a company setting. These are exercises in developing scripted tools and toolboxes for ArcGIS Pro as graded educational material, and resubmitting these as assignments constitute plagiarism.
